# Robot Rock

This repository is a small collection of projects that I created while earning by BSEE degree at the University of Houston.

## 2015 IEEE R5 Robotics Competition Locomotion

This robot was requred to navigate a 7' by 7' maze, recognize printed characters on walls, navigate a bumpy course, and solve the maze as quickly as possible. I was responsible for the locomotion of the robot, which includes the detection of "cells" within the maze, motor control, and maze traversal. This was my fourth embedded systems project but served as an excellent capstone project for my BSEE degree.

## Line Following Robot

A line following robot was developed for an Embedded Systems course. This project used TI-RTOS and the TI Launchboard APIs for control of the RTOS and various peripherals. My second embedded systems project, it was quite an excellent learning experience and served as an excellent foundation for the next project which had similar aspects.
