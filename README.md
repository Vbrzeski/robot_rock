A line following robot developed for an Embedded Systems course at the University of Houston. This project used TI-RTOS and the TI Launchboard APIs for access to the OS and peripheral control. One of my first embedded systems projects, it was quite an excellent learning experience and served as an excellent foundation for the next project which had similar aspects.
